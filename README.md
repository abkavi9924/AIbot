Used a google audio recognition model as Audio recognition is out of my knowdlege spectrum as of now, but i am learning it gradually.
My Machine learning model crashed before completion due to limitations of my pc and am still working on it.
The Road map i created was:
Audio recognition and Text to speech --> Insertion of Book recommending model --> Suggesting a book by reading out its summary and respond in a conversational way(using NLP) --> Launch
